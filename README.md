## 🔍 Project Overview

### 1. `genai_frontend/`  
A **Flutter web application** that serves as the user interface. Key features:
- Upload patient files (e.g., medical reports or x-rays)
- Submit medical data for AI-powered diagnosis
- View results and analysis from the GenAI agents

### 2. `agent-service/`  
A **Python FastAPI service** with two core responsibilities:
- Handle secure file uploads from the frontend
- Initiate agent-based diagnostic workflows by interfacing with GenAI-AgentOS

### 3. `collab/`  
Contains a **Jupyter Notebook** used to host and coordinate the **MCP server**, enabling distributed agent execution for diagnosis.

### 4. `genai-agentos/`  
A **customized version** of [GenAI-AgentOS](https://github.com/genai-works-org/genai-agento) for our solution of AutoClinic.ai, enhanced to:
- Implement diagnosis-specific agents
- Support custom workflows tailored for medical diagnosis and treatment planning use cases
